# hypernova-amp

[Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) bindings for [Hypernova](https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova)
for rendering AMP pages.

## Install

```sh
npm install hypernova-amp
```

## Usage

Here's how use use it in your module:

```js
import { renderReactAmpWithAphrodite } from 'hypernova-amp';
import MyComponent from './src/MyComponent.jsx';

export default renderReactAmpWithAphrodite(
  'MyComponent.hypernova.js', // this file's name (or really any unique name)
  MyComponent,
  {/* Options */},
);
```


## Options

### `prependCSS` (string)
Inserts css before the generated CSS.

### `appendCSS` (string)
Inserts css after the generated CSS.

### `enableAmpBind` (bool)
Set to `true` to enable [amp-bind](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind).
Default: `false`.
This will transform any attribute named `amp-bind-x` into an attribute named `[x]`. This is necessary
because react does not support `[x]` prop even in conjunction with `is` (see next section).

### `enableRemoveIs` (bool)
Utilizes regex to remove `is` attribute. React has an undocumented `is` prop that when added to an element,
prevents React from transforming/filtering props that you add to the element. Any prop that you
add will be added as an attribute with the same name. For example, adding a `class` 
prop to a `<div>` will add a `class` attribute to the `<div>`. This also means that adding a 
`className` prop will not do what you normally would expect it to do. You'll want to add the `is`
prop when using `amp-bind-class` together with `class`, for example. However, the problem arises
where the `is` attribute is also added to the element which causes an AMP validation error. Enabling
the `enableRemoveIs` option will remove the `is` attribute and thus eliminate the validation error.

Here's an example which utilizes `enableAmpBind` and `enableRemoveIs`:

```
<div
  is
  amp-bind-class={`showThing ? '${thingClass} ${thingOpenClass}' : '${thingClass}'`}
  class={ampSearchBarClass}
>
  ...
</div>
```

... elsewhere you might have a button like this:

```
<div
  is
  role="button"
  on="tap:AMP.setState({ showThing: !showThing })"
  tabindex="0"
>
  Toggle Thing Component
</div>
 ```

### `scripts` (array)
Each element of the array is an object with any of the following values:
- `scripts.customElement` (string)
- `scripts.customTemplate` (string)
- `scripts.src` (string): 

### `ampExperimentToken` (string)
Adds `amp-experiment-token` meta tag with token.

### `title` (string)
Page title

### `canonicalUrl` (string)
Adds meta tag with canonical URL.

### `jsonSchema` (object)
Adds json schema meta tag.

### `ampState` (object)
Adds [amp-state tag](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind#initializing-state-with-amp-state).

### `ampAnalytics` (object)
Adds [amp-analytics tag](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/amp-analytics/)

### `ampGoogleAnalytics` (object)
Adds [amp-analytics (google type) tag](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/amp-analytics/)


## Publishing a new release

- Add entry to CHANGELOG.md
- Make a commit, directly onto master, that does nothing but adds/updates the changelog and bumps package.json, with a commit message of â€œvX.Y.Z"
- `git tag vX.Y.Z`
- `git push --tags`
- wait for travis to pass
- `npm install && npm test && npm publish`
